Ensembling Classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches for Morbidity Identification From Clinical Notes

### Motivation
In our research project, we have examined the paper titled 'Ensembling Classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches for Morbidity Identification From Clinical Notes' \cite{tp1}. The paper titled 'Ensembling Classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches for Morbidity Identification From Clinical Notes' addresses the challenge of identifying multiple morbidity factors in patients using their clinical records. 

The authors suggest using classical machine learning and deep learning approaches to automatically detect morbidity factors, which can assist healthcare personnel in handling massive volumes of electronic health records. The paper explores different feature representation methods such as word embeddings and bag-of-words, in combination with CML and DL approaches. Furthermore, it investigates the use of ensemble methods to enhance classification accuracy. The paper concludes that ensemble strategies show better performance for morbidity identification and can effectively leverage both CML and DL approaches.

### Data Download Instructions
We have used the n2c2 NLP Research Data Sets(Unstructured notes from the Research Patient Data Registry at Partners Healthcare (originally developed during the i2b2 project)). For this project, we requested access to the above dataset on the [Harvard Medical School Portal](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/).
